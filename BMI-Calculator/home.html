    <h2>BODY MASS INDEX</h2>
    <article>
        <p>Body mass index (BMI) is a value derived from the mass (weight) and height of a person. The BMI is defined as the body mass divided by the square of the body height, and is expressed in units of kg/m2, resulting from mass in kilograms (kg) and height in metres (m).

          The BMI may be determined first by measuring its components by means of a weighing scale and a stadiometer. The multiplication and division may be carried out directly, by hand or using a calculator, or indirectly using a lookup table (or chart).[a] The table displays BMI as a function of mass and height and may show other units of measurement (converted to metric units for the calculation).[b] The table may also show contour lines or colours for different BMI categories. <a id="readm" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index">read more...</a></p>

        <p>Adolphe Quetelet, a Belgian astronomer, mathematician, statistician, and sociologist, devised the basis of the BMI between 1830 and 1850 as he developed what he called "social physics".[3] Quetelet himself never intended for the index, then called the Quetelet Index, to be used as a means of medical assessment. Instead, it was a component of his study of l'homme moyen, or the average man. Quetelet thought of the average man as a social ideal, and developed the body mass index as a means of discovering the socially ideal human person.[4] According to Lars Grue and Arvid Heiberg in the Scandinavian Journal of Disability Research, Quetelet's idealization of the average man would be elaborated upon by Francis Galton a decade later in the development of Eugenics. <a id="readm" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index#History">read more...</a></p>

        <p>The BMI is generally used as a means of correlation between groups related by general mass and can serve as a vague means of estimating adiposity. The duality of the BMI is that, while it is easy to use as a general calculation, it is limited as to how accurate and pertinent the data obtained from it can be. Generally, the index is suitable for recognizing trends within sedentary or overweight individuals because there is a smaller margin of error.[37] The BMI has been used by the WHO as the standard for recording obesity statistics since the early 1980s. <a id="readm" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index#Public_health">read more...</a></p>
